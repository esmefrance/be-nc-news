This Repository contains two databases. 
You will need to create two .env files for the code to run: 
.env.test and 
.env.development. 

Into each file, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
